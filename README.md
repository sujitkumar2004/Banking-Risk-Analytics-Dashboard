# Bank Loan Risk Analytics Dashboard

This project involves building an interactive dashboard using *Power BI, **Python, and **SQL* to analyze banking risk and support data-driven loan approval decisions.

## Overview

In this project, I developed a robust loan analytics dashboard that allows banking professionals to:

- Assess client loan and deposit behavior
- Segment clients by risk profiles
- Monitor key financial metrics
- Improve the loan approval process with data-driven insights

---

## Tools & Technologies

- *Python (Jupyter Notebook)*: Data cleaning and preprocessing
- *SQL*: Data querying and relational modeling
- *Power BI*: Dashboard creation and KPI visualization
- *DAX*: Custom measures and calculations

---

## Key Features

- *Client Segmentation*: Based on income bands, engagement timeframe, and loan-deposit ratios
- *Dynamic KPIs*: Total Clients, Total Loans, Deposits, Processing Fees, etc.
- *Risk Analysis*: Visual cues for high-risk vs low-risk clients
- *Data Relationships*: Modeled normalized tables with relationships to ensure accurate filtering
- *Interactive Dashboard*: Filters by region, risk category, loan type, and more

## Project Workflow

1. *Data Cleaning (Python)*  
   - Removed duplicates, handled missing values  
   - Created calculated columns: Engagement Days, Income Band

2. *Data Modeling (SQL & Power BI)*  
   - Built normalized table structure  
   - Created relationships between tables

3. *Dashboard Design (Power BI)*  
   - Designed visualizations for Loans, Deposits, Risk Indicators  
   - Implemented DAX measures for key metrics

---

## Outcomes

- Improved visibility into risk-related client behaviors
- Enabled analysts to identify patterns and outliers in client data
- Structured insights for better loan disbursement strategies

## How to Run

This project is available as a Power BI .pbix file and Python notebooks:
1. Clone the repo
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook to inspect preprocessing
3. Load the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop to interact with the dashboard
